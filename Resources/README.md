### Resources for the class
## JavaScript and web development

This is in my experience the best introduction to JavaScript. You should have a look and start learning from it:
- [Brown, Lerning JavaScript](http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph005576713&context=L&vid=NYU&search_scope=all&tab=all&lang=en_US)

The Mozilla pages are very thorogh, too. It gives a good introduction and has a lot of details on all aspects of client and server side development:
- [Mozilla introduction to web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

Very similar however a bit easier to follow - good reference to work on CSS and the HTML page in particular:
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)

### AJAX
- Good video introduction to APIs via AJAX: [JavaScript AJAX XHR for Beginners](http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph005590284&context=L&vid=NYU&search_scope=all&tab=all&lang=en_US)

### jQuery
- another good video intro to jQuery: [JavaScript AJAX XHR for Beginners](http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph005590335&context=L&vid=NYU&search_scope=all&tab=all&lang=en_US)

### APIs through fetch etc. (using ES6 expressions)
- and another video: [AJAX JavaScript XHR and Fetch](http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph005585514&context=L&vid=NYU&search_scope=all&tab=all&lang=en_US)
