## Course Description
This class is about creating interactive web page applications that integrate (“mash-up”) other sources and materials. The goal of the class will be for each student to have 2 well-designed functional single-page web applications by end of semester. Subscribing to a project-oriented approach, a majority of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development. We will use a number of Javascript libraries, e.g. jQuery, Underscore, D3,p5, Three and more, to help build user experiences. Where server-side (back-end) development is required, we will use the Node-Express framework. Students should have some programming experience as well as an exposure to basic client-side web development, specifically HTML and CSS. Experience with Javascript is a plus.

Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This is a production-based course that involves programming work both inside and outside of the classroom. During class, code examples will be presented, written, and reviewed. Examples will iteratively build off lessons learned in preceding classes and students will be encouraged to write code, ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion.

Grading
-------
**10%** Participation (attendance, active participation in class)
**15%** Homework Assignments
**15%** Presentation  
**30%** Midterm Project  
**30%** Final Project  

Rubrics - each 30 points:
* Technical - completion of the technical task, technical competency and insights, documentation
* Creative - creative input, personal expression, meaningful direction and overall thoughtfulness
* User experience -  usability, design, intuitivity

Scale
* A: From 86 to 90 points,
* A-: From 80 to 85 points,
* B+: From 75 to 79 points,
* B: From 70 to 74 points,
* B-: From 65 to 69 points,
* C+: From 60 to 64 points,
* C: From 55 to 59 points,
* C-: From 50 to 54 points,
* D: From 45 to 49 points,
* F: 44 points or lower.


Homework Assignments
--------------------
Generally there will be homework assignments. Homework may include reading, writing, watching videos, doing code exercises, creating web prototypes, and completing projects. Feel free to collaborate with your classmates and work together on any assignment(s). However, generally everyone should share/submit their own individual work.

Class time will be spent going over homework assignments. Expect to be asked to share your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work, other classes only a few students will, but always be prepared to do so. Regardless, your work must be completed by prior to class and ready to be shared, discussed, presented, and critiqued in class

Midterm Project
---------------
The midterm project will involve creating a single page (client-side only) web experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 public web APIs and/or a queryable dataset. You will be expected to present your site, discuss your work, articulate your creative process, and document the entire project.

Readings
--------
Readings will be assigned week by week. 

Attendance
----------
* Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you are going to be late or absent, please email me **in advance**. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.  
* If you are more than 15 minutes late to class with no excuse, it will count as an unexcused absence.
* Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
* Show up on time, we have a lot of material to cover and we'll need all of the class time. 

Participation
-------------
* Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and "being present" is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
* You are expected to show work in class. This includes a working web site, a kind-of working web site, a non-working web site, a failed web site, a web site that works but not the way you expected it to work, and so on. Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn.
* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.
* Respect the "Laptops" and "Mobiel Phones" policy described below. 

Laptops
-------
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific tasks. Whenever classmates are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.

Mobile Phones
-------------
Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call. Otherwise, please refrain from using your mobile phone during class for emailing, messaging, or any other non-class work. 

My availability
-----------
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction, please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course.

Accommodation
-------------
Diversity and inclusion are important tenets of NYUAD and my own teaching philosophy. Please let me know if you have a disability I should be aware of or require special assistance. I am happy to make accommodations.
