# Final Project

Your final project is to design and build an interactive web site. The site should follow your concept that expresses your creativity and be inspired by your research.

The concept makes your thoughts explicit. First, it lays out the sources (things you have researched, like papers, books, websites, other people's code, also functions in code libraries which may not yet have been covered in class). The research should give your project a conceptual frame. It should show that you can on your own build on what you have learned.

The creative concept presents your idea, the point of differentiation of the project, and leads through the aesthetic decisions you make.

The goal is to have the project be presentable at the IM show case.

### Requirements

#### Project concept, documentation and prestenation
- Based on your research
- Showing a thoughtful concept
- Well documented process (Make slides or a short paper of ca. 1500 to 3000 words on how you came up with the concept; show the drafts/sketches and explain your design decisions; tell about the development with the problems and difficulties you faced)
- Well documented code
- Documented user acceptance testing
- A slide deck of web-presentation of 3 to 5 slides explaining your project and introducing it to the class

#### Technical achievments
- The project will be based on JavaScript (you may run other code in addition, like php, Python, etc.)
- The site is interactive - it takes user inputs and reacts
- The site delivers a sensual user experience (it uses dynamic graphics, and/or animation, and/or sound, etc.)
- The site should interact with servers. This can be via APIs or via database calls. Required is either a server-side database backend responding to the site's requests or at least two external APIs that are called and brought together.
- Server-side may be set up on an external or local webserver
- Everything runs and can be presented at IM show case

*Extra Credits:*
- Responsive web design and mobile functionality
- Building your own API (make the site deliver data or information to API calls)
- Accessibility

### Alternative Project Suggestion
As discussed, there is the possibility for a ***hardware mashup***: Setting up a mashup social network for IM, following the example of [occupy.here](https://github.com/occupyhere/occupy.here), originally a political intervention by [Dan Phiffer](https://phiffer.org). Have also a look at [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net/en/) resp. the [Freifunk Github](https://github.com/freifunk). 

We will discuss the detailed requirements for this projects along with working on a proposal.
