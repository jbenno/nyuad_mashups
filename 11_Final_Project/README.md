# Final Project

Your final project is to design and build an interactive web site. The site should follow your concept that expresses your creativity and be inspired by your research.
The goal is to have the project be presentable at the IM show case.

### Requirements

#### Project concept, documentation and presenation
- Based on your research
- Showing a thoughtful concept
- Well documented process (Make slides or a short paper of ca. 1500 to 3000 words on how you came up with the concept; show the drafts/sketches and explain your design decisions; tell about the development with the problems and difficulties you faced)
- Well documented code
- Documented user acceptance testing
- A slide deck of web-presentation of 3 to 5 slides explaining your project and introducing it to the class

#### Technical achievments
- The project will be based on JavaScript (you may run other code, too, like php, Python, etc.)
- The site is interactive - it takes user inputs and reacts
- The site delivers a sensual user experience (it uses dynamic graphics, and/or animation, and/or sound, etc.)
- The site should interact with servers. This can be via APIs or via database calls. Required is either a server-side database backend responding to the site's requests or at least two external APIs that are called and brought together.
- Server-side may be set up on an external or local webserver
- Everything runs and can be presented at IM show case

*Extra Credits:*
- Responsive web design and mobile functionality
- Building your own API (make the site deliver data or information to API calls)
