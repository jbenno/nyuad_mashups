# Week 2: Web Development

### How to view a web page's source code
If using Safari, enable developer options in preferences first. For Chrome and Firefox the source can be viewed directly with the same keyboard shortcut 'option'+'command'+'U' or 'CTRL'+'U' in Windows.

### Example of very simple HTML: The Well
[The Well](https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/506/State-of-the-World-2019-page01.html)

The history of the Well is like a premonition of the history of social media. Here is a great article about what it ~~is~~ was like: [The Epic Saga of The Well](https://www.wired.com/1997/05/ff-well/) by Katie Hafner.

[The Virtual Community](http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/intro.html) by Howard Rheingold is a good original source to understand the Web and early social media.

### Assignment
- Find web pages and "dismantle" their HTML code - delete and add new lines, mashup different pages, etc.
- Look at Mark Napier's mashup web tools [Riot](http://potatoland.org/riot/) and [Shredder](http://potatoland.org/shredder/) and understand what they actually do.
