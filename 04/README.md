## Assignments
- Look through some of the Whitney Artport Commissions (please be considerate about potentially offensive content as discussed in class).\
We will discuss the art next week.
- Your projects: draft it (sketch the concept, write a few words about it), built it (code it, test it, put comments into the code and document the features in a few words), describe it (make a few slides or write a blog post about it), present it next monday.
